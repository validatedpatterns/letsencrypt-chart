## Usage

In order to enable this chart in your patterns, please add and edit the
following lines to `values-AWS.yaml`:

```yaml
letsencrypt:
  region: eu-central-1 # region of the cluster
  server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
  # staging URL
  # server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
  email: foo@bar.it

clusterGroup:
  applications:
    letsencrypt:
      name: letsencrypt
      namespace: letsencrypt
      project: default
      path: common/letsencrypt
```

## Values

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| global | object | depends on the individual settings | Dictionary of the global settings to configure this chart |
| letsencrypt | object | depends on the individual settings | This section contains all the parameters for the letsencrypt chart in order to request CA signed certificates in a Validated Pattern By default if you include this chart you enable the letsencrypt charts on both the *.apps.<domain> ingress and on the API endpoint |
| letsencrypt.certmanagerChannel | string | `"stable-v1"` | String the channel to install cert-manager from (Defaults to "stable-v1") |
| letsencrypt.duration | string | `"168h0m0s"` | Duration of the requested letsencrypt certificates (Defaults to 168h0m0s) |
| letsencrypt.email | string | `"test@example.com"` | String containing the email used when requesting certificates to letsencrypt (required) These two lines need tweaking for every deployment. @example.com emails will be rejected by letsencrypt |
| letsencrypt.nameservers | list | `["8.8.8.8:53","1.1.1.1:53"]` | List of DNS server (ip:port strings) to be used when doing DNS01 challenges (Defaults to [8.8.8.8:53, 1.1.1.1:53]) These two are needed because the DNS01 ACME solver needs outside DNS servers and won't really work with openshift's internal split-view DNS servers https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/#setting-nameservers-for-dns01-self-check |
| letsencrypt.organizations | list | `["validatedpatterns.io"]` | List of organization names to be put in a certificate (Defaults to [validatedpatterns.io]) |
| letsencrypt.region | string | `"eu-central-1"` | String that defines the region used by the route53/dns01 resolver in cert-manager (required) |
| letsencrypt.renewBefore | string | `"28h0m0s"` | How long before expiration date should the certs be renewed (Defaults to 28h0m0s) |
| letsencrypt.server | string | `"https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"` | String containing the letsencrypt ACME URL (Defaults to the staging server) By default we use the staging URL to avoid any ratelimiting while testing To switch to the production certificates signed by a recognized CA, please switch to the non-staging URL (see values.yaml) |
| letsencrypt.usages | list | `["server auth"]` | List of certificate uses. See API cert-manager.io/v1.KeyUsage (Defaults to [server auth]) |

## Notes

Please be aware of the following gotchas when using this chart:

1. Once the API certificate has been replaced with the letsencrypt one, the `oc` commands might fail with x509 unknown certificate authority errors.
   You need to remove the previous CA from the kubeconfig file. Run: `oc config set-cluster <clustername> --certificate-authority="/dev/null" --embed-certs`
2. When you switch to non-staging letsencrypt certificates, things might fail if you asked for too many certificates over the last few days.
3. The cluster takes ~20-30 mins to fully settle when both the API endpoint and the default ingress certificates are implemented

## Implementation

This chart creates a Cloud Credential that is allowed to write and read DNS
entries via Route53 in AWS. That credential is then used by cert-manager to
prove ownership of the DNS zone and answer the ACME DNS01 challenges.

We ask for a single wildcard certificate for the default Ingress `*.apps.domain`
and one non-wildcard certificate for the API endpoint `api.domain`.

We use Argo's Server-Side Apply feature to patch in the Ingress Controller and
the API endpoint certificates.

Currently we also patch the main cluster-wide Argo instance to set the tls
route to `reencrypt` in order have a proper cert there. Once issue 297 in the
gitops-operator repository is fixed, we can drop that.
